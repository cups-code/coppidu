# Wiki Navigation
This wiki has loads of stuff, and is organised in multiple parts to make viewing this content universe easier.

## Campaign
- Each campaign is created as a folder in the wiki.
- It holds all the [[#Arcs]] and its contents.
- It may also hold metadata and information that would be considered meta in gameplay. This will be put outside of the arcs folders.

## Arcs
- Each typical *chapter* of the campaign consists of an "arc". 
- An arc marks milestones of the campaign's party. For instance, an arc can consists of multiple milestones which allow the characters to level up.
- Arcs also help organise the party's certain time or location. For example, Arc 1 is held in the year 817 AC (After Calamity).
- An arc holds the synopsis (basic summary before the current arc), all tracked quests, and all handouts given during and after sessions.

## Miscellaneous Folders
- The Gallery is used to store all public images which is then embedded and previewed in relevant notes.
