# Building Character Depth
Now that you have the bare bones structure of your character, let's "flesh it out" and make it feel somewhat real and built like an actual character within a story. Remember, tabletop roleplaying games are about building a collaborative story worth telling.

## Making A Backstory
- Each character has their own story before they started their campaign. Good key ideas for building a backstory are:
	- stories with your relevant backgrounds and ancestries
	- a tale of *why* you started adventuring
	- mentioning allies and foes
	- creating strengths and flaws
- A good idea on where to start is to fill in your *Details* page first, this allows people to imagine what your character would look, sound, and *be* like
	- This also mentions your factions, ethnicity, and religion which can all be key factors for your character.
- A backstory also allows for new landmarks and new plot lines which may expand the worldbuilding of the campaign. Please consult with your GM before making a new landmark.

## Reviewing The Backstory
- Your GM will review your backstory ideas and suggest modifications accordingly. It is possible that certain things may be omitted from your backstory due to story conflicts and just simply not being able to.
- Landmarks, NPCs, allies, and factions must be reviewed before you can write it down in your backstory.

## Applying Your Ideas
- Once you have ideas and it has been reviewed for your backstory, you may put them in the *Notes* tab of your character sheets.
- You can create multiple pages for your Notes, allowing you to segregate and organise each part of your notes including your backstory. For example, one page could be for your backstory, one could be for writing all relevant treasure found, and etc.
- Your backstory does not need to be a whole paragraph. If you find it easier, dot points would work too.

## Submission
- After all the bits and bobs of making your character feel more complete is done, submit the character sheet directly to the GM for approval.
- Please note that last-minute modifications may happen.

# What's next?
- Read through your campaign's relevant arc pages. You can find them [here](https://cups-code.github.io/coppidu/(!)-Getting-Started/character-depth).
