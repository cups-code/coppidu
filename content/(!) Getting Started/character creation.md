# Character Creation
So you've decided to join this little Pathfinder content universe? Maybe you're joining a campaign that is within this content universe, or you just decided that maybe you just want to make a character. For whatever reason it is, it doesn't matter. Let's get right into it.

## Knowing The Necessities
- Firstly, read and remember all the necessary resources that you should know. These include the official standard reference document (SRD) and the character builder we are using. These can be found [here](https://cups-code.github.io/coppidu/(!)-Getting-Started/character-depth).
- Knowing where to find the location of where every single piece of content about Pathfinder is documented (and it's made by Paizo, the official creators) is extremely beneficial in the long run. You will be able to 

## Creating An Online Character Sheet (CS)
- To begin, go to your character builder of your choice. It is STRONGLY recommended to use Wanderers' Guide as it heavily integrates with our current campaign, allowing your character to be viewed by the GM and modifications to be done live.
- We will use Wanderers' Guide for this example. It can be found [here](https://wanderersguide.app/). (Disclaimer: You are required to make an account. Registering an email through the app does not work at the moment.)
## Wanderers' Guide
- When you have made an account, navigate to the Characters section by clicking the menu that appears when you click on your profile (top-right).

## Joining The Campaign
- Enter the campaign key. The join key should have been provided to you through direct/private message.![[campaign_key.png]]
	- By default, this will allow you to have all of the required sourcebooks for the available options in game.
	- If you are prompted to override current sourcebook selections, please 'Apply Settings'.
- Go through the *Builder* by selecting an ancestry, background, class, and its respective boosts, feats, and features.
## Finalising Your Sheet
- Click the > arrow to go next. You should see a character sheet similar to the image provided. (The sheet may be cropped off due to your zoom level. Just scroll to see more details.) ![[cs_showcase.png]]
- You may read through each part of the sheet to view your *Feats & Features*, fill out your *Inventory* with the provided 150 SP, or create [[character depth]] in the *Details* and *Notes* section.
- And, you're done! Be sure to read what each thing does by clicking on the item. For example, you can click on the Performance skill to see its description, breakdown of the stat, relevant actions, and the timeline of updates on that skill. (The timeline updates will only be relevant as the campaign progresses.) ![[skill_preview_showcase.png]]
# What's Next?
- It's time to flesh out your character. Head to [[character depth]] for more.
- Alternatively, you may consult with your GM for the next steps and learn more about Pathfinder as a system.
