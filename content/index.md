# Welcome to Coppidu
Coppidu is the central universe of multiple campaigns hosted with the Pathfinder system. These are the following campaigns.
- Tales of Songbird (began 16.11.24) - a casual playtest campaign designed to learn the core mechanics with the GM and players

# Wonderful Resources
- Pathfinder 2e Reference Document - https://2e.aonprd.com/
	- Useful for all things Pathfinder
	- Lists all of the monster art, stat blocks, and rules
	- Documentation from all publicly available sourcebooks from Paizo
- Wanderers' Guide - https://wanderersguide.app/
	- Useful for character creation (I personally prefer the aesthetic over Pathbuilder)
	- Allows campaigns and characters (1 campaign limit sadly)
