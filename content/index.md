# Welcome to Coppidu
Coppidu is the central universe of multiple campaigns hosted with the Pathfinder system. These are the following campaigns.
- Tales of Songbird (began 16.11.24) - a casual playtest campaign designed to learn the core mechanics with the GM and players

This wiki was built to provide public and helpful information to the players involved in this content universe. We expect this content universe to be expansive and timeless, and hopefully, I'll be committed to it. You can find more about how the system works through the [[navigation]] page.

## Your To-Do List
1. Read through this page
2. Go to [[navigation]] to see how this works
3. Make your character through [[character creation]] and building it with [[character depth]]
4. Read through your relevant campaign's files (e.g. if you are in Tales of Songbird, go to the Tales of Songbird folder and read through the notes such as [[A1 - Synopsis]])
	- You can find more relevant pages to your respective campaigns [here](https://cups-code.github.io/coppidu/(!)-Getting-Started/character-depth)

# Wonderful Resources
- Pathfinder 2e Reference Document - https://2e.aonprd.com/
	- Useful for all things Pathfinder
	- Lists all of the monster art, stat blocks, and rules
	- Documentation from all publicly available sourcebooks from Paizo
- Wanderers' Guide - https://wanderersguide.app/
	- Useful for character creation (I personally prefer the aesthetic over Pathbuilder)
	- Allows campaigns and characters (1 campaign limit sadly)
- Concepts Guide (by How It's Played) - [link here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYCDCUfG0xJb5I-wDIezuDkTfbd8k21Km)
	- Useful for knowing the concepts of Pathfinder one by one
	- This most likely assumes you know basic tabletop RPG d20 systems such as D&D
	- Allows skimming through only specific concepts, permitting you to find what you need

# Relevant Pages
- Tales of Songbird
	- [[A1 - Synopsis]] - a brief summary of the beginning of the campaign arc (in this case, Arc 1)
	- [[A1 - Handouts]] - any handouts after sessions that may be useful later
	- [[A1 - Quest Tracker]] - any quests that are currently active, this is usually updated after a session
