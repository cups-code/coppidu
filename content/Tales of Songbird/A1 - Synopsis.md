In the realm of Coppidu, kingdoms arose and sought to control the world. In return, the world had established law and order. No one exactly knew how all of this started, and its ancient past has been long forgotten, but there is one moment that has not been forgotten. The present.

An adventurer duo, a powerful minotaur and a magical human, were nomadic citizens of their kingdom who were fuelled by curiosity and maybe treasure. Maybe riches. They were out for everything. However, an incident occurred in one of their adventurers which made them lose everything they fought for.

After a year-long hiatus, a bit more training, and getting some money to *actually* survive in the kingdom, they were able to go out on quests for small cash, with a *few* inconveniences. Will this be their redemption to their rank as an adventurer?
